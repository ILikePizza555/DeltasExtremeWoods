# Delta's Exteme Woods Mod

```
i'm still salty that the generator as of beta 1.8 onward is just objectively less interesting than the b1.7.3 and prior generator
as i've said before, the reason is because they wanted to make it so specific biomes could dictate the shape of the terrain
since before you could get any kind of ridiculous mountain structures in any biome
biomes only changed the surface blocks and vegetation
this is totally fine on paper
but they made the new biomes too realistic to their real-world counterparts
